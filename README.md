# CPSwarm Stage Simulation Manager

This is a Simulation Manager to be used in the [CPSwarm Simulation and Optimization Environment](https://github.com/cpswarm/SimulationOrchestrator/wiki/Simulation-and-Optimization-Enivornment). 
Specifically this Simulation Manager is designed to integrate the [Stage](https://github.com/rtv/Stage) simulator. 
This can be used in combination with the [Simulation Orchestrator](https://github.com/cpswarm/SimulationOrchestrator) to run a simulation 
and with an optimization tool, like [FREVO](https://github.com/cpswarm/FREVO) to run an optimiziation.
